 *
 * For form-based authentication, you have to map [Security.login]
 * to the login action, `/s_login`, as described in [Security]:
 *
 *     "/s_login": security.login,
 *
 * If you'd like to login in an Ajax request, SOAP or others,
 * you can invoke this method directly by providing the username, password
 * and, optional, rememberMe:
 *
 *     //prepare username, password, rememberMe from, say, Ajax
 *     security.login(connect, username: username, password: password,
 *       rememberMe: rememberMe, redirect: false);
 *
 * For other cases, you can use [Security.setLogin] (such as implementing
 * auto sign-in).
 *
 * * [username] - specifies the user name. If not specified, [useranme]
 * [password] and [rememberMe] will be retrieved
 * from HTTP request's body (by use of
 * `HttpUtil.decodePostedParameters(connect.request)`).
 * * [rememberMe] - whether remember-me is enabled or disabled.
 * If omitted (null), remember-me won't be updated.
 * It is meaningful
 * only if the constructor is called with a [RememberMe] instance.
 * * [redirect] - whether to redirect back to the original URI
 * (`connect.request.uri`). If omitted, it means true.
 * Notice: if [redirect] is false, the caller has to handle
 * [AuthenticationException] in `catchError` (if true, it is handled automatically).
 *
 * * [handleAuthenticationException] - whether to handle [AuthenticationException].
 * If false, the caller has to handle by himself.
 * Also notice that if [redirect] is false, it also implies *no* handling of
 * [AuthenticationException].
 *
 * * It returns a [Future] object (never null) to indicate when it completes.

 *
 * If you'd like to logout in an Ajax request, you can invoke this method
 * directly:
 *
 *     security.logout(connect, redirect: false);

/** The security module.
 *
 * ##Usage
 *
 * First, you have to implement [Authenticator]. For sake of description, we use
 * a dummy implementation here called [DummyAuthenticator]:
 *
 *     final authenticator = new DummyAuthenticator()
 *       ..addUser("john", "123", ["user"])
 *       ..addUser("peter", "123", ["user", "admin"]);
 *
 * Second, you can use `SimpleAccessControl` or implement your own access control
 * ([AccessControl]):
 *
 *     final accessControl = new SimpleAccessControl({
 *       "/admin/.*": ["admin"],
 *       "/member/.*": ["user", "admin"]
 *     });
 *
 * Finally, instantiate [Security] with the authenticator and access control
 * you want:
 *
 *     final security = new Security(authenticator, accessControl);
 *     new StreamServer(uriMapping: {
 *       "/s_login": security.login,
 *       "/s_logout": security.logout
 *     }, filterMapping: {
 *       "/.*": security.filter
 *     }).start();
